# Security Considerations

This document outlines known security risks in gamecode-mcp2. MCP is early technology - allowing LLMs to execute system commands is inherently dangerous. This implementation prioritizes auditability over security features.

## Critical Risks

### 1. No Authentication
- **Risk**: Any process that can spawn the server has full tool access
- **Mitigation**: Run only in trusted environments, use OS-level process isolation
- **Future**: Consider adding client authentication in MCP spec

### 2. Unrestricted File Access
- **Risk**: Tools can read/write any file accessible to the server process
- **Mitigation**: Run with minimal privileges, use OS-level access controls
- **Configuration**: Carefully audit all file-related tools in YAML

### 3. Arbitrary Command Execution
- **Risk**: YAML configuration controls what commands can run
- **Mitigation**: Protect YAML files with strict file permissions
- **Best Practice**: Use allowlists, avoid tools that accept arbitrary paths

### 4. No Resource Limits
- **Risk**: DoS through resource exhaustion, long-running commands
- **Mitigation**: External process monitoring, container resource limits
- **Impact**: Single-threaded design means one bad command blocks everything

## Deployment Recommendations

### For Development
- Run in isolated development environments only
- Use containers with resource limits
- Restrict network access
- Regular audit of tools.yaml

### For Production
**Not recommended** without additional security layers:
- Authentication proxy
- Command allowlisting
- Audit logging
- Resource limits
- File system sandboxing

## Security Model

This implementation trusts:
1. The process spawning the server
2. The YAML configuration files
3. The file system permissions

It does NOT provide:
- Authentication or authorization
- Command sandboxing
- Path validation
- Resource limits
- Audit trails

## Reporting Security Issues

Please report security concerns to the repository maintainers. Given the experimental nature of MCP, security issues are expected.

## Input Validation (Optional)

Version 0.5+ includes optional input validation to mitigate LLM injection attacks:

### Available Validations
- **Path traversal prevention** - Reject `..` and absolute paths
- **Null byte detection** - Prevent filesystem termination attacks  
- **Suspicious pattern logging** - Warn on shell metacharacters
- **Type validation** - Ensure arguments match expected types

### Philosophy
Like 1990s CGI scripts, LLM tools face injection risks. Our approach:
1. **No shell interpretation** - Already safe from command injection
2. **Optional validation** - You choose what to validate
3. **Transparent logging** - See what the LLM attempts
4. **Configuration-driven** - Control validation in YAML

See `examples/tools/secured.yaml` for validation examples.

## Future Considerations

As MCP matures, consider:
- Capability-based security model
- Signed tool configurations
- Built-in sandboxing
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

Remember: This implementation is intentionally minimal to be auditable. Every line can be reviewed, but that doesn't make it safe - only understandable.
