# Microsoft Teams Bot Options for Secure Environments

## Outbound-Only Approaches

### 1. **Outgoing Webhooks** (Simplest, but Limited)
- Teams can POST to your endpoint when @mentioned
- **Problem**: Still requires an endpoint (even if internal)
- Not truly outbound-only

### 2. **Azure Bot Service with Direct Line** (Polling-Based)
- Bot polls for messages instead of receiving webhooks
- Works behind firewalls
- More complex setup

### 3. **Graph API Polling** (Recommended for Security)
- Your bot polls Microsoft Graph API for messages
- Truly outbound-only - no incoming connections
- Requires app registration but no exposed endpoints

### 4. **Teams Toolkit with SSE** (Newer Option)
- Server-Sent Events for real-time without webhooks
- Still requires some endpoint exposure

## Recommended: Graph API Polling Bot

For maximum security in restricted environments, polling the Graph API is best:

```
Your Bot → (polls) → Graph API → Teams Messages
Your Bot → Graph API → Send Response
```

### Pros:
- No incoming connections required
- Works behind strict firewalls
- No webhooks or exposed endpoints
- Can run in air-gapped networks with egress-only

### Cons:
- Higher latency (polling interval)
- More API calls (watch rate limits)
- Requires Azure AD app registration

## Implementation Comparison

| Feature | Slack Socket Mode | Teams Graph Polling |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Incoming connections | None | None |
| Real-time | Yes | No (polling delay) |
| Setup complexity | Low | Medium |
| API limits | Generous | 15,000/user/hour |
| Authentication | App + Bot tokens | OAuth2 + App |

## Which Approach?

For your security requirements (no incoming webhooks), I recommend:

1. **Graph API Polling** - Most secure, truly outbound-only
2. **Azure Bot with Direct Line** - If you need lower latency
3. **Avoid**: Traditional Bot Framework (requires webhooks)

The Graph API approach is similar to how some email-to-SMS gateways work - poll for new messages, process, respond via API.
