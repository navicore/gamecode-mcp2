  # Example tool that would use injected tenant/environment values
  - name: query_tenant_data
    description: Query data for the current tenant
    command: ./scripts/query-tenant.sh

      - name: query
        description: SQL query to execute
        required: true
        type: string
        cli_flag: --query
    # The script would access GAMECODE_TENANT and GAMECODE_ENVIRONMENT
    # environment variables that are automatically set from --inject

  - name: deploy_to_environment
    description: Deploy application to current environment
    command: ./scripts/deploy.sh
    args:
      - name: version
        description: Version to deploy
        required: true
        type: string
        cli_flag: --version
    # The script would access GAMECODE_ENVIRONMENT to know where to deploy

# Usage:
# gamecode-mcp2 --inject tenant=customer123 --inject environment=staging --tools-file multi-tenant-example.yaml
#
# The tools will have access to:
# - GAMECODE_TENANT=customer123
# - GAMECODE_ENVIRONMENT=staging
#
# This ensures the LLM cannot override these security-critical values
